## Neuro‑Symbolic AI Projects Hub <sup>MIT • Python</sup>

A curated hub of **neuro‑symbolic AI** topics that integrate neural models (LLMs) with symbolic reasoning (ontologies, rule engines) to deliver **accurate**, **explainable**, and **robust** systems.

> 📌 The following are **topics only** (no external links), summarizing the scope and purpose of each track.

### Topics

* **Neuro‑Symbolic Interaction** — Enhance LLM accuracy with OWL‑backed knowledge integration; expose corrections with logical explanations via a simple demo UI.
* **Neuro‑Symbolic Ontologic Transformer** — Axiom‑guided generation to reduce hallucinations by enforcing logical constraints during token prediction.
* **AI Chatbot with Rules & Ontology (ODM)** — End‑to‑end diagnostic chatbot pipeline: OWL ontology → IBM ODM (XOM) → business rules → chatbot.
* **Neuro‑Symbolic Decision: Trade Compliance** — Real‑world EU–US trade‑compliance assistant (G‑CoW) combining LLM understanding with a symbolic tariff engine aligned to evolving 2025 regulations.
* **watsonx‑NeuroSymbolic‑Decision** — A generic, containerized platform: agents, connectors (watsonx.ai, Ollama), symbolic systems (ODM, ontologies), sample services, and a chatbot front‑end.
* **Fine‑Tuning with Ontology‑Guided GRPO** — Train Llama‑3.2 for factual consistency using reinforcement signals from a diabetes ontology; includes LoRA and hybrid validation.
* **Validate NLP Answers with Ontologies** — Practical multi‑pass validation with the Human Phenotype Ontology: exact/fuzzy matching, embedding similarity, and OWL reasoning.
* **ADORE: Agent‑driven Ontology Repair & Evolution** — Multi‑agent framework to propose/validate/repair knowledge; resolves inconsistencies via axiom weakening with HITL oversight.
* **Multi‑Agent MCP Stack (GRAPH‑RAG)** — Scalable stack for regulatory/contract analysis: vector search + knowledge graph, traceable citations, governance/HITL, and full audit trail.
